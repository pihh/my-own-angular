Simple project to learn more in depth ES6 concepts like proxys, reflection, decorators and so on.
The objective is to make a simple framework that tries to mimic ngx ( by parsing DOM, creating custom HTML elements with event and data listenters) 

Note: Not to use in production, this project is just for learning purposes
